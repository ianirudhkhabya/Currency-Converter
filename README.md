# Currency Converter React Project

A simple currency converter web application built using React and Vite as the project tool. It allows users to convert between different currencies, providing real-time exchange rate information via an API.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ianirudhkhabya/Currency-Converter.git
   cd Currency-Converter
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run the following command to install the project dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**

   Start the development server with the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the application at `http://localhost:5173/`. You can access it in your web browser.

4. **Build for production:**

   If you want to build the project for production, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will generate optimized production-ready files in the `dist` directory.
